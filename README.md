## Frameworks:

- Next.js
- React
- Angular
- Vue.js

## Usage

The CLI tool will need to be running while the Next.js application is running with `npm run dev` or `npm start`. This will allow the CLI tool to capture the logs in real-time and provide suggestions for error fixes as they occur.

In other words, the CLI tool will be running as a separate process in the terminal alongside the Next.js application. The developer would start the Next.js application with `npm run dev` or `npm start` and then run the CLI tool in a separate terminal window or tab. The CLI tool will continuously monitor the logs generated by the running Next.js application and provide suggestions for error fixes in real-time.

It is essential to ensure that the CLI tool is running continuously to capture all the logs generated by the Next.js application. The tool should also be designed to automatically restart in case of any failures to ensure that it can continue monitoring the logs.

## Installation

To install the npm-copilot package, run the following command:

`npm install -g npm-copilot`

Disclaimer:
The CLI tool will begin monitoring the logs generated by the Next.js application and provide suggestions for error fixes in real-time.

## Configuration

In order to use this package, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.env` file, or by setting it directly in your terminal:

For Windows systems:
